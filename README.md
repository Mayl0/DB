# DB
Assignment for University.

We have to create a functional Database for our assignment.
Our sample DB is similar to that of GoodReads. It represents a book reviewing web site
and all it's data.

So in order, to make it more realistic, we use the GoodReads API to collect
real world data about Books, Authors and reviews.


# Requirements

1) Goodreads API wrapper for python --> https://github.com/sefakilic/goodreads

2) PostegreSQL adapter for python --> http://initd.org/psycopg/

3) PostegreSQL
